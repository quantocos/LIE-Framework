# LIE Cheat Sheet (For Everyone)

**How to get consistent, useful results from AI — without technical knowledge**

> You don’t need to know how AI works.
> You just need to tell it **what box it must stay inside**.

This cheat sheet shows you how.

## The Big Idea (1 minute)

AI doesn’t understand meaning.
It **predicts words** based on patterns.

So instead of *asking nicely*, you must:

* tell it **what job it is doing**
* give it **only the information it needs**
* tell it **exactly what the answer should look like**
* tell it **what to do if it’s unsure**

That’s it.

## The 8 Things Every Good AI Request Needs

Think of this as **filling out a form**, not having a chat.

### 1️⃣ What do you want? (Goal)

Be very specific.

❌ *“Help me understand this”*
✅ *“Summarize this text in 5 bullet points”*

---

### 2️⃣ What role should AI play?

Tell AI **what job it is doing**.

Examples:

* Analyst
* Editor
* Teacher
* Planner
* Checker
* Writer

✅ *“You are an editor checking grammar.”*

---

### 3️⃣ What should it NOT do?

This is very important.

Examples:

* No guessing
* No creativity
* No opinions
* No outside knowledge

✅ *“Do not add information that is not provided.”*

---

### 4️⃣ Give background (only facts)

This is **information**, not instructions.

Examples:

* “This is for a school project.”
* “This text is about health.”
* “The audience is beginners.”

❌ Don’t say what to do here
✅ Just say what it needs to know

---

### 5️⃣ Give the input clearly

Always separate input from instructions.

Use markers like:

```
TEXT START
...
TEXT END
```

This prevents confusion.

---

### 6️⃣ Tell it how to work (simple steps)

Don’t say *“think carefully”*.
Say **what steps to follow**.

Example:

1. Read the text
2. Identify key points
3. Remove repetition
4. Rewrite simply

---

### 7️⃣ Tell it what the answer must look like

This is the most ignored step.

Examples:

* “Give 5 bullet points”
* “Answer in a table”
* “Reply in short paragraphs”
* “Only yes or no”

AI behaves much better when shape is fixed.

---

### 8️⃣ Tell it what to do if unsure

This stops hallucinations.

Examples:

* “If unsure, say ‘Not enough information’”
* “If missing data, ask one question”
* “If confidence is low, stop”

---

## One Simple Template (Copy–Paste Friendly)

You can use this for **almost anything**:

```

[Any facts or context]

INPUT:
[Your text or data]

STEPS:
1.
2.
3.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[How the answer should look]

IF UNSURE:

```

---

## Real Example (Simple)

**Task:** Improve an email

```
GOAL:
Rewrite the email to sound professional and clear

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Talking emotionally
❌ Giving mixed instructions
❌ Asking multiple tasks at once
❌ Letting AI decide the format
❌ Assuming AI knows your situation

---

## Mental Shortcut (Remember This)

> **Tell AI:**
>
> * who it is
> * what it must do
> * what it must not do
> * what the answer must look like

That’s LIE — without the name.

---

## Final Truth (Very Important)

AI is powerful **only when boxed in**.

If you leave space, it fills it with guesses.
If you give structure, it gives results.

---

### One-Line Rule

**Less chatting. More framing.**
